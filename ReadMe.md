# DS 1.1: Data Analysis & Visualization

## Course Description

In this course, students learn the foundational skills of data science, including data collection, scrubbing, analysis, and visualization with modern tools and libraries. Students gain a strong grounding in statistical concepts, utilize statistical techniques and master the science and art of data exploration and visualization to tell stories and persuade decision makers with data-driven insights.

## Prerequisites:  

[CS 1.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.2-How-Data-Structures-Work)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to...

1. Conduct data manipulation and visualization
1. Understand when to reject or accept a null hypothesis
1. Apply descriptive statistics, probability, and other forms of data analysis techniques
1. Describe and implement a plan for finding and dealing with problems in a dataset such as null values and outliers
1. Perform statistical analysis on data collections using a variety of methods
